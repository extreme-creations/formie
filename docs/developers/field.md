## Custom Validation
You can add custom validation to field, to handle all manner of scenarios. To do this, you'll need to create a custom module to contain PHP code for the validation logic.

:::tip
Make sure youâ€™re comfortable [creating a plugin or module for Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com/docs/3.x/extend/). Take a look at this [Knowledge Base](https://craftcms.com/knowledge-base/custom-module-events) article for a complete example.
:::

If you write your own plugin or module, youâ€™ll want to use its `init()` method to subscribe to an event on the `Submission` object to add your validation rules. Your event listener can add additional [validation rules](https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/2.0/en/input-validation#declaring-rules) for fields.

For example, let's say we have a field with a handle `emailAddress` which we'd like required. We could do this with the following.

```php
use verbb\formie\elements\Submission;
use verbb\formie\events\SubmissionRulesEvent;
use yii\base\Event;

Event::on(Submission::class, Submission::EVENT_DEFINE_RULES, function(SubmissionRulesEvent $event) {
    $event->rules[] = [['field:emailAddress'], 'required'];
});
```

Or, maybe we only want a field required when another field is a certain value.

```php
Event::on(Submission::class, Submission::EVENT_DEFINE_RULES, function(SubmissionRulesEvent $event) {
    $event->rules[] = [['field:emailAddress'], 'required', 'when' => function($model) {
        return $model->subscribeMe;
    }];
});
```

Here, we check if a field with handle `subscribeMe` is truthy, and if so make the `emailAddress` field required.

Another example could be limiting a field to be numeric, and a maximum length.

```php
Event::on(Submission::class, Submission::EVENT_DEFINE_RULES, function(SubmissionRulesEvent $event) {
    $event->rules[] = [['field:accountNumber'], 'number', 'integerOnly' => true, 'max' => 9];
});
```

You can also customise the validation message with number validation when using min/max with `tooSmall` and `tooBig`.

**However**, the above rules are applied to _every_ submission, which will throw an error if you set a rule for a field that doesn't exist on the form for the submission you're creating. The above example assumes you have a field with the handle `emailAddress` for every form, which may not always be the case, especially if you have multiple forms.

Instead, you'll want to add a conditional check what form you're creating a submission on.

```php
Event::on(Submission::class, Submission::EVENT_DEFINE_RULES, function(SubmissionRulesEvent $event) {
    $form = $event->submission->getForm();

    // Only apply this custom validation for the form with handle `contactForm`
    if ($form->handle === 'contactForm') {
        $event->rules[] = [['field:emailAddress'], 'required'];
    }
});
```

If you have a lot of forms, or would rather not conditionally check _every_ form for your site, you can loop through the available fields for the submission, to add a check whether the field exists. This can be useful if you want to enforce a validation for all email fields across your site, but not every form has an `emailAddress` field.

```php
Event::on(Submission::class, Submission::EVENT_DEFINE_RULES, function(SubmissionRulesEvent $event) {
    if ($fieldLayout = $event->submission->getFieldLayout()) {
        foreach ($fieldLayout->getFields() as $field) {
            // Check against the handle of the field
            if ($field->handle === 'emailAddress') {
                $event->rules[] = [['field:emailAddress'], 'required'];
            }

            // Or, for a more global-check - against the type of the field
            if ($field instanceof \verbb\formie\fields\formfields\Email) {
                $event->rules[] = [['field:emailAddress'], 'required'];
            }
        }
    }
});
```
